#### üî® Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- ANOVA, STL, sklearn, LinearRegression, StandardScaler, KMeans
- Jupyter Notebook

2. A/B testing
   - *Result: Campaign_Type: F = 0.41, p = 0.8031*
   - *Channel_Used: F = 1.53, p = 0.1776*
   - *There is no difference in profitability between campaigns and channels.*

3. The graph and the result of the test ANOVA (Target_Audience: F = 0.57, p = 0.6847) show that there is no difference in the influence of the target audience on CAC.

4. Time dynamics of advertising channel indicators
   - *CAC: Gradual increase since June.*
   - *ROI: Seasonal growth in April and August to December.*
   - *Conversion Rate: Fall in April and rise from August (probably during holiday periods).*

5. Seasonality
   - *CAC: There has been a gradual increase since May. Trend: up (0.97)*
   - *ROI and Conversion Rate: No significant growth is observed. Trend: (0.00)* 

6. By campaign type, Effective campaigns are 15.3% more effective than Average campaigns and 18.2% more effective than Ineffective campaigns. All companies have similar results.

#### üí° Recommendations
- Focus budget across all channels during holiday periods for maximum ROI.
- Increase your use of video ads on Facebook and YouTube.
- Segment the target audience and develop individual strategies for young people and older generations.
- Reduce investment in used channels if CAC remains high.
- Monitor the dynamics of indicators monthly to identify new trends.
